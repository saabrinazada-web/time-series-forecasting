# Time Series Forecasting: SARIMAX vs ARIMA

This project compares the performance of SARIMAX and ARIMA models for forecasting GDP per capita. The analysis was conducted using Python in Google Colab, and all results are included in the notebook.

## Dataset
- Dataset included in the repository (for demonstration purposes)
- Time period: [Jan 2003 - Dec 2024]

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels)
- Google Colab
- Microsoft Excel (optional for preprocessing)

## Tasks
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Model building: SARIMAX & ARIMA
3. Forecast evaluation and comparison
4. Visualization of predictions

## Results
- SARIMAX showed improved accuracy over ARIMA for this dataset
- Forecast plots and model comparison metrics included in the notebook

## How to Use
- Open the `SARIMAX_vs_ARIMA.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
- Run each cell to reproduce the analysis and plots

## Notes
- Dataset is for demonstration; original data may be confidential
- Designed as part of academic portfolio for data analysis and time series modeling
